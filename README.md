# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
### The purpose and background 
Steve has the workbook I prepared but he wants it to be more efficient if there are thousands of stocks to analysis. The purpose of the project is to refactor the initial code, and make the VBA script run faster.

## Results
### Stocks outperformed in 2017 but underperformed in 2018. The refactored script execution time decrease compared to original script.
